# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of the project

Using Jupiter notebook and pandas we created data series and data frames for the ride sharing data, we also produced publications with a visual story with complex findings using Matplotlib, which will help us communicate our analysis with less complexity, therefore the information presented will be easier to deliver and understand.

## Results of our analysis

- The rural area has the lowest total rides and drivers, but the highest average fare per ride and per driver.

- The urban area has the highest count of the total rides, drivers, and fares. However, it has the lowest average fare per ride and per driver. 

- In both rural and suburban areas, the total number of drivers is higher than the total count of rides. While in the urban area there is a difference between the number of drivers compared to the number of rides, which means that there is a significant number of drivers who couldn’t complete not even one ride.

The below graph presents the difference in total fares per week per city.

- The three areas have a spike in the total fares around the middle of march.

- The rural and suburban areas have a decrease in total fares in April, while at that same time the urban area have an increase in total fares.

## Summary

Our recommendations would be as follow:

- Work on increasing the number of rides in the urban area by advertising for the service and offering better deals to encourage people to use it more, which results in creating more opportunities for the drivers.

- On the other hand, the reduced number of rides in the rural and suburban areas might be because of the slow service or lack of drivers which results in fare increase and longer wait time, since there is more demands than offers, in this case the company should work on hiring more drivers. 

- The average fare per driver in the rural area is $55.49, while it goes down to $16.57 per driver in the urban area. This means that drivers in the urban area charge lower than the normal fare so they can have more rides, which is not fair for them. This give us more room to increase the prices which will be more beneficial for the drivers and can attract more people to apply and be employed. 

- Investing in campaigns and enforcing effective social media presence during the times where the number of rides decreases. It is normal to have a slightly different volume of consumers throughout the year, but it’s also important to try our best to be consistent in order to keep providing a good quality of service and continuous opportunities for the drivers throughout the year.
